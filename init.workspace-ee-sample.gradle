//// Use this script file as a sample on how to pass properties to Gradle build which
//// are user-specific (and possibly sensitive) and should not be put into source control.

// Usage:
//      ./gradlew --init-script=init.gradle distBundleZip
//
// The project properties are set in the init script through SystemProperties, Gradle
// will parse these and set project properties accordingly. For details, see Gradle docs:
//      * https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html
//      * https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties

// in file 'init.workspace-ee-sample-encrypted.gradle'.
